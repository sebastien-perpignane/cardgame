# Getting Started

## What is cardgame ?

cardgame, for now, provides two games engines : war game and "belote contr√©e". 

It allows me to practice multiple programming skills :

* implements more complex things that you usually code in a web business app.
* apply multithreading concepts learned by reading but rarely practiced.

War game was just a warm-up. The final objective of the project is a try to provide a contree game with a modern dynamic GUI.

## How to build 

Java 17 is required. I suggest to install the JDK with [SdkMan](https://sdkman.io/).
