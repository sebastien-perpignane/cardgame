# Getting Started

## What is cardgame ?

cardgame, for now, is just a war card game played by two bots, displayed in the console.

It allows me to practice multiple programming skills :

* implements more complex things that you usually code in a web business app.
* apply multithreading concepts learned by reading but rarely practiced.

The final objective of the project is a try to provide a framework that would facilitate implementation of any kind of classical card games.

## How to build 

Java 17 is required. I suggest to install the JDK with [SdkMan](https://sdkman.io/).

Once JAVA 17 installed, just run : 

    ./mvnw package
    java -jar ./target/cardgame-*.jar
